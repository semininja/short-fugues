# short-fugues
Bach organ fugues for brass quintet

Instructions for use:

To compile a score, use the command `make dir=<directory>` where the directory is the fugue you wish to compile, eg. `make dir=BWV553` to compile the first piece.

Releases will include pieces that are relatively performance-ready. To download the compiled pieces, select the most recent version in the "Releases" tab near the top of the page.
